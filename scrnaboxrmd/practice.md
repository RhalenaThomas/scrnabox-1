## Cell marker genes
Download `/gdp` from step7 on your working path `WDP`, cell marker genes and seurat object are  the `de_genes` and  `seu.int`, respectively



```r
WDP='/Volumes/F/for_my_website/scrnabox0/related_to_scrnaR'
setwd(WDP)
mk_genes<-readRDS(paste0(WDP, "/gdp/de_genes.rds"))
seu.int<-readRDS(paste0(WDP, "/gdp/seu.int.c.rds"))
```


Select top 2

```r
mk_genes %>%
    group_by(cluster) %>%
    top_n(-2, p_val_adj) -> top_sel
```


```r
top_sel
```

```

## No trace type specified:

```


### Spliting
If you want to split the contrast into up and down, you can run the following codes

```r
file_path=paste0(WDP,'/cont_inte')
dest_path=paste0(WDP,'/cont_split')
scrnaboxR::split_up_down(file_path,dest_path,cut_pvalue=0.05,cut_log_low=-0.25,cut_log_up=0.25, n_row=200)
```

### Distance between contrasts

```r
file0<-extract_file(dest_path)
con<-file0[[2]]
```




```r
#png(file = paste0(WDP,"/heatmap.png"), bg = "transparent")
image(1:dim, 1:dim, dst, axes = FALSE, xlab="", ylab="")
label0<-file0[[1]]
axis(1, 1:dim,label0 , cex.axis = 0.5, las=3)
axis(2, 1:dim, label0, cex.axis = 0.5, las=1)
text(expand.grid(1:dim, 1:dim), sprintf("%0.1f", dst), cex=0.6)
```

```r

```

### Dit plot

```r
gwas_genes<-read.csv(file=paste0(WDP,'/all_PD_gwas_loci_genes_filtered.csv'))$hgnc_symbol
file_path=paste0(WDP,'/cont_split')
des_path=paste0(WDP,'/Output')
