## Accuracy
### Clustering accurary
ACC: Computes one subtract of the error rate; it uses the hungarian method to macth to clusters.  
AMI: Adjusted Mutual Information
NMI: computes the normalized mutual information
RI: Rand Index
ARI: Adjusted Rand Index

###  Assocation measure
Cram√©r's V:  is a measure of association between two nominal variables, giving a value between 0 and +1 (inclusive)

## Computation

```{r}
X<-sample(c('a1', 'a2'), 1000, replace=TRUE)
Y<-sample(c('b1', 'b2', 'b3'), 1000, replace=TRUE)
compute_index(X,Y)
```
